Stepping into tech during the AI revolution brings both opportunities and questions. After reading [Addy Osmani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/addyosmani/)'s recent [insights on the future of software engineering](https://addyo.substack.com/p/future-proofing-your-software-engineering), I want to share what truly matters for those beginning their journey.

What makes a standout junior developer today? The fundamentals remain crucial, but they're evolving. Here's what to focus on:

- **Deep understanding of data structures and algorithms** - these aren't just interview topics, they're your foundation for solving real-world problems
- **System design principles** - start with the basics but learn how different parts of an application connect
- Hands-on experience with **version control and collaborative development**
- **Critical thinking to evaluate AI-generated code** - remember, AI is a tool, not a substitute for understanding

Notice what's missing? Perfect grades. While academics matter, your ability to solve real problems and work effectively in teams carries far more weight.

Think differently about your learning journey: Could you contribute to open source? Build solutions for local community problems? These practical experiences often teach more than classroom assignments alone.

In an era where AI handles routine coding, your value lies in understanding context, spotting edge cases, and thinking critically about solutions. These skills come from hands-on experience, not textbooks.
