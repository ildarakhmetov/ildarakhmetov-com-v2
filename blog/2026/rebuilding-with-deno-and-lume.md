My personal website was boring.

It was a standard Jekyll site. It worked, but I wasn't learning anything new while maintaining it (as a result, I was not really maintaining it).

So this weekend, I decided to rebuild it with one rule: I had to use a tech stack I had never touched before.

I asked Gemini for recommendations and landed on [Lume](https://lume.land/), a static site generator for [Deno](https://deno.com/) that uses [Vento](https://vento.js.org/) for templating.

I had zero experience with any of them. Perfect.

A few hours and 25 commits later, the new site is live.

Since I'm definitely not a designer, I asked for a "trendy" aesthetic and ended up with Neo-Brutalism and a Bento Grid (let me know if it's way too ugly!)

I made [the repo](https://github.com/ildarakhmetov/ildarakhmetov-com-v2) public. I believe "building in public" is a great habit, especially for students. Show your work, even (or especially) when it's just a weekend experiment.

What’s a random tool you learned recently just for the fun of it?
