I love this new stack of books on my desk. 

These are the books that I recommend to my students. This is not my entire list of recommendations, but these are the ones I could afford to buy on paper at this time.

I want to be able to bring a paper copy to class, show it, let my students hold it and flip through it. 

Then they can read an online copy for free (O'Reilly Learning, you rock 😍).

Meanwhile, during my breaks, I grab one of the books and read it. The one at the top is my plan for tonight - Befunge, I'm ready for you!
