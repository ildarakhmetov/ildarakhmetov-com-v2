The Walnut Model (Process & Content Model), which I first heard about from [Natalia Babaeva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalia-babaeva-a3633734/), offers a really practical way to think about teamwork. It was originally shared by [Ola Möller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olamoller/) ([MethodKit](https://www.linkedin.com/company/methodkit/)) and comes from [Hyper Island](https://www.linkedin.com/school/hyper-island/), where it’s used to help teams work better together.

The idea is simple. Balance:
- WHAT the team is working on, with
- HOW the team works together.

This balance is key to making any project run smoothly—whether it’s a big work project or a student group assignment.

The image shows how the focus shifts throughout a project. Early on, teams need to spend time on the process—getting aligned, setting roles, and making sure everyone’s on the same page. As things move forward, content (the actual work) takes over. But if you don’t keep checking in on the process, even the best teams can run into trouble. That’s when things start to feel rushed or fall apart toward the end.

What makes this model so helpful is knowing **when to shift gears**. You need both teamwork and production to stay in sync—too much of one without the other, and things get messy. When a team can ride these waves the right way, projects feel more manageable, and everyone stays on track without last-minute stress.

In student projects, this approach really makes a difference. It helps teams focus not just on finishing the task but also on learning how to work well together. The Walnut Model is a great reminder that success isn’t just about the final product—it’s about how you get there.
