What are your CliftonStrengths?

My top 5 are Competition, Strategic, Learner, Achiever, and Futuristic.

If you've never heard of CliftonStrengths, formerly known as StrengthsFinder, it's a tool for identifying personal talents. It assesses 34 talent themes, revealing natural patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving.

But does this self-awareness really impact your life? Well, it does. When you know what your strengths are, you can use them to grow in your own way. Both personally and professionally. No wasting time on something that is not you.

The assessment is an $80 investment, but I'd say it's worth it. Even if you think you know your personality well, the report is full of insights. And if you think you're just exploring your strengths and weaknesses, this can be a really priceless piece of information.
