    Inspiration can come at any moment.

Every Saturday, my son and I head off to his soccer games. I really look forward to it. The long drives? I don’t mind at all. It’s our time. We've built many fun little traditions along the way, like stopping for our favorite snacks or choosing our favorite playlists. These are moments I’ll always treasure.

But today, there was something else I was excited about. As soon as I got home, I raced to my computer. Yesterday, an idea for a little coding project hit me, and I couldn't resist sketching out the foundation before bed. I didn’t finish it, but today? I couldn’t wait to dive back in.

That feeling -- it's still there, just like it was when I first started coding. When an idea strikes, I HAVE to sit down and make it happen. It’s almost like a fire burning in my belly -- a creative drive that I can’t ignore.

I’ve heard artists describe something similar when they can’t wait to pick up a paintbrush, or musicians when they’re itching to write a new song. For me, it’s about writing code. That spark lights up when I sit down and open VSCode to bring an idea to life.

Just the other day, a student asked me, “How do you decide which projects to focus on? Which languages to practice?”

My answer? Follow the fire in your belly. Find what stirs that creative spark inside you and chase it. Whether it’s coding, painting, or composing, that drive will lead you to where you need to be. So, listen to it -- and let it guide you.
