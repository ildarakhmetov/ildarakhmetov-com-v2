I’m writing this post from my office at 7:40 p.m. on a Friday evening — a perfect time to reflect on workaholism, right? The irony isn’t lost on me. It’s one of those moments that makes you think, “Am I living what I’m writing about?” But here I am, contemplating balance while staying late at the office.

The [article](https://hbr.org/2024/09/a-workaholics-guide-to-reclaiming-your-life) I just read had some great insights, and it made me think about a saying from my first department chair: *80% of the problems you’re posed with will be resolved if you just wait*. There’s real truth in that. So often, we’re driven by the need to solve everything immediately, treating every task as urgent. But in reality, most things don’t need immediate attention, and time itself can be a great problem-solver.

That idea connects with the article’s point about redefining “urgent.” I’ve been trying to get better at asking myself, “Does this really need to be done now?” and it’s surprisingly liberating. It’s a mindset shift that doesn’t come naturally to most of us, but it’s worth practicing.

What stood out to me even more was the focus on *psychological detachment*. It’s not just about closing the laptop—it’s about actually allowing your mind to rest. I’ve realized that stepping away physically is one thing, but mentally letting go? That’s the real challenge. Whether I’m out for a run or spending time with family, if my brain is still in work mode, I’m not truly detaching.

So as I sit here finishing this post—on a topic that hits close to home—I’m reminded that finding balance isn’t just about working less. It’s about recognizing when something can wait and giving yourself the space to recharge. And maybe, just maybe, those "urgent" tasks will be part of that 80% that didn’t need my immediate attention after all.
