Students often ask me: "I want to learn cloud technologies, but where do I start?" It’s a fair question because cloud technologies can feel overwhelming. Just looking at the list of AWS services can be intimidating, and that was true even a few years ago. So, where should you begin?

Start by registering for [AWS Skill Builder](https://skillbuilder.aws/). It’s a fantastic resource that’s filled with tons of free e-learning content. Whether you’re new to the cloud or looking to deepen your knowledge, this platform has you covered.

For those who are just getting started, the [Developer Learning Plan](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/learning_plan/view/84/plan) is a great place to begin. It’s only 10 hours long and provides a solid introduction to serverless development, which is one of the most useful paradigms in the cloud.

If you already have some cloud experience and are looking for more breadth, the [Solutions Architect Learning Plan](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/learning_plan/view/1044/plan) could be your next step. It’s a comprehensive course that takes around 50 hours to complete, covering the essentials of AWS services in greater depth. This plan is also free.

One key piece of advice: after you complete a course, don’t rush into the next one. Pause, and try building something on your own. Pick an example from the course and adapt it to something that interests you. It could be anything -- a small web app, a personal dashboard, or a tool that solves a problem you care about. The important part is that it’s your project, and by building something that matters to you, you'll solidify what you’ve learned.
The key is not just to consume information but to create with it. Start small, use these free resources, and focus on making projects that are meaningful to you. It will make the learning process far more enjoyable and effective.

Happy cloud learning!
