As everyone’s talking about OpenAI’s o3 and Google’s Gemini 2.0 -- their crazy new capabilities, and the wave of startups and prototypes they’re inspiring -- I can’t help but wonder...

...the competition in *anything AI* is getting brutal. Any idea you come up with today? Someone is coding it right now, and they’ll launch it tomorrow. The AI space has become a bloody red ocean, filled with fierce, almost frantic competition.

But what about humans? Today's blue ocean might not be in building with AI, but in building for and around human intelligence. Products that deeply involve people -- our creativity, problem-solving, and even just how we connect with each other -- might be the less obvious, but more promising bet.

What do we do with that? Honestly, I don’t know yet. But it feels like a question worth exploring.

Thoughts?
