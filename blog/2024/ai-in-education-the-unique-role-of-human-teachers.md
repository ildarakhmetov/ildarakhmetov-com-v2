Yesterday, I had the pleasure of attending an AI meetup (thank you for organizing, Kris Krüg!). The energy in the room was palpable. AI applications are permeating every facet of our lives, and education is no exception. From apps and services to chatbots—text-based, voice, and even video—the pace of innovation is dizzying.

    AI and Education: The Role of Human Teachers.

The opportunities AI presents in education are vast. It can explain concepts and answer learners' questions with an infinite patience for follow-ups. But there is a pressing question: What is the role of the human teacher? Do we, as educators, **compete** with AI, or do we **leverage our unique strengths** in tandem with these tools?

I think it's the latter. The essence of teaching goes beyond just passing on knowledge. It’s about creating a personal connection, a unique chemistry between teacher and learner that no AI can replicate. This connection fosters motivation and helps teachers find the key to each student's unique potential—a profoundly human ability.

AI can be a fantastic assistant in the educational process. It can take over repetitive tasks, provide basic instruction, and offer instant feedback. However, the role of a human teacher is irreplaceable when it comes to the nuanced aspects of education. Motivating students, understanding their individual needs and challenges, sharing personal experience and being a relatable role model are areas where human teachers excel.

So, as educators, we need to adjust our approach. We should delegate what we can to automated tools, freeing ourselves to focus on what only we can do—cultivate personal connections, inspire, and mentor.

This shift requires us to enhance our emotional intelligence, embracing it as our superpower in the classroom.
