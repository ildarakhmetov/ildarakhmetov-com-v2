This is my summer science project :-)

Did you know that a bunch of fluffy, dry leaves + a weekly drop of vegetable scraps can turn into this nice, greasy soil by September? So impressive!

I've been the "compost guy" in our community garden for a few years now, and it's nice to have this project that doesn't require a laptop.

This year, the process became even more efficient when we partnered with a local restaurant (thanks, [Kirsten Bartel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirsten-bartel-ba8212a/), for setting this up!). They supplied a couple of buckets of compostable scraps each week, so my job was to fluff the stuff up (to add oxygen) and water the bins from time to time.

Do you have a "no laptop" project? What is it?
