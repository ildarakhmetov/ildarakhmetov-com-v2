🎓 Showcasing one of the fantastic projects from last semester's CMPUT 401 students at the [University of Alberta](https://www.linkedin.com/school/university-of-alberta/)! 🌟

Students collaborated on a project called \_MigBench for the SMR lab 🛠️🖥️. The lab developed a valuable dataset on Python library migrations, and our students created an online queryable version of the PyMigBench dataset, making it accessible to researchers and software developers worldwide 🌍.

The team had a blast working together, and their strong teamwork was evident as they successfully tackled the tasks:

- Converting the YAML-based dataset to a relational database
- Exporting all YAML data onto the database
- Building an admin tool for uploading new YAML data
- Developing an intuitive tool for users to query the dataset
- Making the website visually appealing
