You have a cool idea, but people don't seem to get it.

What to do?

    Pitching Ideas by Jeroen van Geel
</div>

Here is the process Jeroen van Geel offers in this book:
1. Define the goal you want to reach
2. Grab the core of the idea you have
3. Understand who you need to convince to reach your goal
4. Prepare yourself for the pitch
5. Deliver the pitch

Pretty simple framework -- and yet very clever. You should never jump to the pitch before you know all the answers.

It is a concise and to-the-point book, so it'll take you only a couple of hours to get a good sense of the ideas. Then, you can get back to the specifics and prepare your perfect pitch.
