Our students joined forces with [Communakit](https://www.linkedin.com/company/communakit-inc/) to create the Communakit App, designed to be used alongside their Speech and Language Learning Kits. This app allows educators and students to track progress and maintain digital records with ease.

The team opted for Flutter as it provided adaptability and compatibility with various platforms, ensuring a seamless user experience for both iOS and Android.

Throughout this project, the team engaged with the client [Robyn Maul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robyn-maul-042a621a6/) to understand their vision and requirements. They held daily meetings and worked diligently to transform their ideas into a functional app.

Kudos to the team for their dedication and hard work, which not only combined language learning and technology but also showcased innovation in education!

Thank you, [Robyn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robyn-maul-042a621a6/), for being a fantastic client!
