📚 Introducing another fantastic project from last semester's CMPUT 401 students at the [University of Alberta](https://www.linkedin.com/school/university-of-alberta/)! 💫

Our students partnered with NSTEP, a non-profit organization focused on teaching healthy habits to children through nutrition and physical activity programs, to develop an innovative web app called Storytelling App - Helping people share their story 🎤📖.

The Storytelling App enables NSTEP program post-attendees to provide feedback in various formats, including audio, video, and text. It also allows NSTEP staff to collect, store, and analyze that feedback 📝🔍. Key features include creating a questionnaire, responding to a questionnaire, and viewing feedback. Additionally, a super admin can create and manage admin accounts and their permissions 🔐👥.

The app was built using React for the frontend, Django for the backend (including the Django REST framework), and MySQL as the database, offering a clean and intuitive user interface suitable for users with various technical backgrounds 🌐🖥️.

Throughout the project, the team learned valuable lessons:

- Tasks may take longer than anticipated
- There is often a pre-existing solution to a problem (don't reinvent the wheel!)
- Importance of clean and easy-to-use UI/UX for diverse users
- Overcoming challenges and roadblocks in software development

We extend our gratitude to [Darlene Schindel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darleneschindel/), [Melissa Gruber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melissa-gruber-3a47b7131/), and Brandon Gruber of NSTEP for providing the opportunity to collaborate on this meaningful project 👏🤝!

Congratulations to the dedicated team for their hard work and exceptional teamwork! 🌟👩‍💻👨‍💻
