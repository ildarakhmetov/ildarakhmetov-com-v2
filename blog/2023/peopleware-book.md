This is how the first chapter of this book starts.

We know that the most difficult problems in software development teams are people problems, not technical ones.

This book will help you solve such problems. But, even more importantly, it'll make you think about software development as something that extends far, far beyond writing code.

Each of the 39 chapters is a teamwork dimension. It tells a story, explains the mechanisms behind it and provides a box of tools.

A clear must-have for your bookshelf.
