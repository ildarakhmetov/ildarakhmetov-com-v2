🎓 Presenting another outstanding project from last semester's CMPUT 401 students at the [University of Alberta](https://www.linkedin.com/school/university-of-alberta/)! 🌟

Students collaborated with Funke Smith, Founder and CEO of [Skillcity Institute](https://www.linkedin.com/company/skillcity-institute/), to create an amazing web app called Pathfinder (formerly Skillcity Platform) 💼🌐. The app aims to support young individuals in exploring and working towards potential career pathways, connecting them with mentors, companies, and relevant opportunities 🤝🎯.

Pathfinder was built with Django and Next.js (React), ensuring safety and privacy for all users 🔒💻. Our students took the vision and turned it into a reality, receiving rave reviews from the client! 🚀🤩

Throughout the project, the team learned valuable lessons:

- Mastering new frameworks, languages, and libraries
- Importance of planning for a clear path and team alignment
- Effective communication and healthy discussions in software development

A big thank you to Funke Smith for the opportunity to collaborate on this meaningful project 🙌!

And congratulations to the team for their commitment and exceptional teamwork! 👏👩‍💻👨‍💻
