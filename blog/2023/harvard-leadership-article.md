This [article](https://hbr.org/2005/04/seven-transformations-of-leadership), published in the Harvard Business Review in 2005, is one of the few true masterpieces. You will read and reread it as you grow and develop as a leader (and many of you will).

If you have ever led a team, reflect on your experience and think about your current leadership style. Then you will see your next step and how to get there.

An interesting thing about this text is that descriptions of leadership styles that are +1 level above you usually don't make sense. You'll clearly understand the level you're at, all the levels below, and only one level above. However, the descriptions of the higher levels are likely to be extremely confusing.

But you will grow as a leader, and in a few years, you may be surprised at how clear the next stage looks now!
