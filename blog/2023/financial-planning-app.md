Some student teams in CMPUT 401 accomplish such amazing results that it's hard to believe it's possible. Meet one of these teams.

I still find it hard to grasp that they did what they did. Just watch the video and you'll see. This fintech app, including a fully functional back-end and front-end, integrated with financial accounts, was developed in less than three months by six students at the [University of Alberta](https://www.linkedin.com/school/university-of-alberta/).

Simply an incredible achievement, beyond all expectations. Thank you, team!

And a special word of thanks to [Sam Yasinski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-yasinski-285a90199/) for hosting this project and guiding the team. This would not have been possible without your entrepreneurial spirit.
