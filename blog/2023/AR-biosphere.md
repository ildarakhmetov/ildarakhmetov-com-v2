Our students have teamed up with the Aquatic Biosphere Society of Canada to create an MVP with the motto "Explore the Ecosystem with AR Biosphere - An immersive learning experience for all!" 🌊🐟🌳

Sometimes, life pulls us away from the beauty and magic of nature. But with AR Biosphere, an engaging Augmented Reality (AR) application, users can dive into the wonders of the fascinating Alberta ecosystem, learning about the incredible species of our province.

Imagine waking up one day and discovering stories of aquatic life that you never knew existed. 💧🐠 That's the magic of AR Biosphere. Our dedicated student team worked with passion, communication, and innovation to bring this vision to life. And the result? Users can explore, learn, and connect with the natural world like never before - all at their fingertips! 📱🌎

Thank you, [Paula Polman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulapolman/), for the opportunity to impact public engagement and conservation through such a meaningful project. 🤝🙏

I'm grateful for the support and guidance of our incredible TA, [Yazeed Mahmoud](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yazeedsabil/), who shared his infinite Unity knowledge. 🌟
