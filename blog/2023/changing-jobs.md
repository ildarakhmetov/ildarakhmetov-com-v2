My first semester at [Northeastern University Vancouver](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/northeasternvancouver/) has wrapped up. It's a milestone that comes with its own set of reflections and realizations.

Was it easy leaving the U of A? Not at all. I had a deep connection to my work, my students, and my colleagues there. I miss them -- a lot.

But here's the thing: I'm really enjoying my new job at Northeastern. It's a different environment, but it's invigorating in its own right.

One of the best parts? Teaching Align students. Align is this unique program that bridges the gap for non-CS majors to enter the tech world in just one year. It's an intense year, but it opens doors to a master's in computer science. It's demanding, sure, but incredibly rewarding.

Changing careers is hard, and for my students, it's been a journey. A lot of hard work went into it. But the results? They speak for themselves. These students started with zero programming experience. Now look at their [final projects](https://www.youtube.com/@CS5001Projects).

Really impressive. I'm really proud of what they accomplished.

As the year winds down, I'm already looking forward to January. Back to the classroom, back to the excitement of learning and teaching. Here's to the next chapter at Northeastern!
