What are you reading this week?

These are the two books I'm reading right now.

    Database Internals & Dostoyevsky.

I always try to have at least one technical and one non-technical book to read at any given time.

We need technical books to learn new hard skills. Blogs, videos, and social media are great, but we still need books to get real learning.

Do we read fiction just for fun? Of course not. Reading good literature (that's Dostoyevsky on the right) is the best way to understand other humans. Which is definitely harder than any database or programming language.
