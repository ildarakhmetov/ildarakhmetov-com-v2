Crafting a resume can be painful. Especially if you're a student and it's your first resume. Word templates are confusing. Online resume-generation tools require a paid subscription.

Now, there is a solution.

Meet the open-source Student Resume Generator, developed by CMPUT 401 students!

Non-technical folks can use it as a [web app](https://studentresume.org/), and developers will enjoy the power of the Python package and the CLI tool (pip install studentresume, and voila).

User experience is the key, so there is no sign-up/log-in nonsense. Simply create your resume and download it as a JSON file. Need to make changes? Just upload the saved JSON. Full privacy, nothing is stored on the server.
