I had no idea a conference could be such a blast. At CSL'apalooza, we did everything from farming to helping seniors, and even packing rice for the food bank. This was not your typical conference - it was an un-conference, a place to let loose while learning about Community Service Learning.

The unique set-up of CSL'apalooza truly embodied the essence of service-learning: merging learning goals with community service. We spent two solid days soaking in new experiences and growing together. Big shoutout to [David Peacock PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-peacock-phd-2b519681/), [Jill Flaman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jill-flaman/), [Erin Kelly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erin-kelly-yeg-educator/), Alyssa McPhail, [Katie Kincaid](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katiemkincaid/), [Zenashe Aytenfisu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zenashe-aytenfisu/), and Lisa Prins for making all of this magic happen. I'm walking away inspired, energized, and ready to put all that we've learned into action!
