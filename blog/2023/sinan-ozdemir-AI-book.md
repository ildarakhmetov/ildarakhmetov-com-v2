This book by [Sinan Ozdemir](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sinan-ozdemir/) might be a perfect launching pad. This was my plane reading for a few weeks and I really enjoyed it. It's straightforward, practical, and very easy to read. Just right for someone who is tech-savvy but new to AI.

And yes, it's available on [O'Reilly Learning](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/quick-start-guide/9780138199425/?_gl=1*i2rq1k*_ga*MTA4MDk4MTEwNy4xNzA1NDkxOTg5*_ga_092EL089CH*MTcwNTQ5NTIyNS4yLjEuMTcwNTQ5NTIzOC40Ny4wLjA.) (free for many students).
