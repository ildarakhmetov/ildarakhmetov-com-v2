I'm a huge fan of esoteric programming languages, or "esolangs," which challenge conventional coding with humor and artistry. The other day, I met [Wayne Malkin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wayne-malkin-45b9304/) at a hackathon, and he mentioned Forth, sparking my curiosity.

I thought, "Why not dive into some more fun languages this summer?" That's when I found the gem, Strange Code by [Ron Kneusel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rkneuselbooks/). It's unlike typical programming books - it celebrates the pure joy of writing code.

Strange Code reminds us that programming is about creativity, experimentation, and enjoying the process. Though not for your day job, esolangs will reshape your thinking and spark your creative spirit.
