It's that time of year when classes are in full swing and free time seems like a distant memory from another life. Yet here I am, finding that teaching CS 5001 isn't just a job; it's a joy ride.

As my students dissect algorithms and debug their way through the course, I'm right there with them. They're learning, and I'm not? Not fair!

So what did I do? I went to [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-express-mongodb-bootcamp/) and grabbed a course - right there, take a look at this screenshot.

Node.js and I have never really crossed paths, so it's a new challenge for this old-timer.

So every day, when the sun starts to dip and my home office lights dim, that's my cue. Thirty minutes carved out just for me and the code.

I have to tell you, it's a lot of fun.

What's lighting up your neurons in these busy times? Share what you're learning; I'm all ears.

Stay curious and code on.
