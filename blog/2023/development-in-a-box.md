I love it when CMPUT 401 alumni come back as CMPUT 401 clients.

It's hard to imagine a better client than someone with 401 experience who knows all the course's ins and outs.

In Winter 2021, [Taylor Christie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taylor-christie/) was one of the best students. Next semester, Taylor returned as a client and co-founder of Zero RampUp, developer of Dev in a Box, a project that lets developers create any kind of containerized system with ease.

The CMPUT 401 team had to create a custom user interface for tech-savvy users and did it exceptionally well. It was a pleasure seeing students overcome technical challenges and make their app better each week.

The final MVP was fully integrated with a payment system and implemented all the features the client asked for.

Way to go, team!
