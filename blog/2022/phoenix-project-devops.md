Eliyahu Goldratt's brilliant novel The Goal is one of my favourite books. I read it twice, both times from cover to cover.

The Phoenix Project follows a very similar story. In The Goal, Alex Rogo managed a production plant where everything was always behind schedule.

In The Phoenix Project, Bill Palmer is a VP of IT in a company where deployments take weeks to complete, only one guy knows how systems work together, and every day is constant firefighting. Eventually, Bill will solve the problems by introducing the culture of DevOps and agility.

An absolute must-read for anyone interested in DevOps and the way IT works beyond the level of writing code.
