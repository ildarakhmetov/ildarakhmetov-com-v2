AI Shading uses machine learning models to create shades that automatically adjust based on the current weather. Last Winter, CMPUT 401 students worked with Zack Zhang and his team on a data analytics module for their product.

It was not an easy project by any means, but the team did a fantastic job, delivering a full-stack application (Spring Boot for the back end, React for the front end) on time.

There was certainly a fair amount of creativity involved. The team even had to work with overseas vendors and translate Chinese technical documentation!

Great job, team, and good luck scaling the business, Zack!
