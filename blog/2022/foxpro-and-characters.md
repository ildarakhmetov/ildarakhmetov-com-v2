Did you know that in FoxPro (a database management system by Microsoft from the 1990s), the interpreter cared only about the first four characters of any keyword?

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img src="/assets/img/blog/2022/foxpro.jpg" alt="FoxPro" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" />
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Microsoft's FoxPro.
</div>

For example, instead of MODIFY STRUCTURE, you could write MODI STRU.

So, reading FoxPro code was... fun at times. It could be full of commands like:

```
- REPL
- APPE
- CREA
- BROW
- DELE
```

FoxPro was fun, I miss it sometimes.
