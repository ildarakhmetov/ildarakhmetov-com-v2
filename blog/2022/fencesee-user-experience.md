It's always exciting to work with startups, and this project proved that the unique energy of a startup could bring the vibe of entrepreneurship to a software engineering class.

I'm delighted to see the final result of this project. Jonathon Machinski and Noni Hua provided exceptional guidance to students, and the team delivered a fantastic product despite a tough learning curve (well, can it be easy in 401? I don't think so!😉)

Way to go, team!
