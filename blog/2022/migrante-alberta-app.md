Mobile development is never easy. Especially when you have to deal with a new framework (Flutter) and a new language (Dart).

This team bravely conquered the learning curve and delivered a fantastic, fully functional app will all requested features.

Well done, team, and thank you for hosting this project, Marco Luciano!
