I’m honoured and grateful to be recognized as an honorary member of P.A.L.S. - Project Adult Literacy Society.

P.A.L.S. is doing vital work, changing lives through literacy, and I’m happy to be a part of the literacy movement in Alberta. P.A.L.S. is also a unique place with a special vibe, and it always feels so good to come to the P.A.L.S. office and meet the learners, staff and volunteers.

Thank you, Monica, Adam, Erin, and Della, for your support and everything you do for the learners and volunteers.
