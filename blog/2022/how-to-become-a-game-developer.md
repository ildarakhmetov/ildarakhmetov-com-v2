Today I talked about it with a group of kids at the Edmonton Immigrant Services Association Summer Camp.

The thing is that you do NOT have to be a programmer to succeed in the game dev world!

Do you like to draw? Don't drop it, practice more, and you can be a game artist (2D or 3D, up to you).

Do you often break stuff, making adults mad at you? Well, maybe that is the start of your career in testing. You will come to the office to play video games. Even more fun, you'll be playing games with the intent of breaking them. If THAT is not a dream job, what is a dream job?!

But well, there's an even better one. Become a game level designer. You'll come to the office to design the best ways of putting wooden boxes under green piggies. Literally. And they will pay you for doing THAT.

How to get there?

1. Do math
2. Draw
3. Be creative!
4. Learn a programming language and write some code!

Practice consistently, and you'll be there. We know that 10000 hours can bring anyone to the top. Hard for me at 38, but super easy for a 10-year-old!
