Another truly exciting project implemented by CMPUT 401 students! No doubt, one of the most successful projects of Winter 2021.

In addition to offering resources related to black history and mental health supports, the app grants individuals and businesses access to economic opportunities including job postings, B2B connections, and mentorships. Individual users can use the CCACH app to search their area for job opportunities, mental health resources, and mentors in their field.

Thank you for hosting this project, Sandra Muchekeza!
