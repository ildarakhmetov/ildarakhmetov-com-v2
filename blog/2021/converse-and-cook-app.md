It's the best time of the year. Fourteen amazing MVPs are completed by CMPUT 401 students, and all fourteen are production-ready. What a blast we had this semester!

So hard to choose which screencast to show first. So, eeny, meeny, miny, moe...

Converse and Cook App! Add a recipe using any units. Scale it up to any number of people. Generate a shopping list for a volunteer to buy everything in bulk and upload a receipt. Cook and share the meal! Bon appetite!

Great job, team! And thank you for bringing this amazing project to CMPUT 401, Mishma Mukith and Juanita Gnanapragasam!
