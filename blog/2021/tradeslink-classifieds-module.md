Happy to showcase one more successful CMPUT 401 project. I love working with startups, and we had a fantastic experience working with TradesLink last semester. Sam Beaudoin and his team did their absolute best to support the students on their way to the successful MVP. Thank you for this opportunity to work with you, TradesLink!

Great job, team! A well-deserved shoutout to all of you.
