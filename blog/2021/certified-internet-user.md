No one would certify you as an Internet User now, right? Well, it was a bit different 20 years ago ;) So, I am an Internet User, and I have a proof.

    My Internet User Certificate.

Back then, I was fortunate to have 30 hours of free dial-up monthly from a local ISP in return for help with some simple PHP coding.

For a 17-year-old, these 30 hours were true gold. It felt like I had unlimited Internet access. Of course, back then, you had to be clever. I dialled up having a list of websites I want to check, URLs already typed into the tabs of my Opera 3.60. Then, quickly open everything and disconnect to enjoy the pages offline.
