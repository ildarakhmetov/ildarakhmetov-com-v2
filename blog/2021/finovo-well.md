Financial, physical and mental wellness go hand-in-hand. And I'm glad that CMPUT 401 students had a chance to work on this tool that can help employees manage their financial wellness.

The idea is simple but powerful: fill out the questionnaire and get recommendations tailored for you. Software at its full power!

Thank you for bringing this exciting project, Russ Dyck!
