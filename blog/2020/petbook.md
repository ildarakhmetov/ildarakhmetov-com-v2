Walt Disney used to say that it’s kind of fun to do the impossible. Well, CMPUT 401 teams can totally relate to that. Is it even possible to develop a product in three months if NO ONE in the team knows the chosen programming language?

Totally possible. Meet Petbook, a working prototype developed in Flutter+Dart by the team who had had zero experience with Flutter and successfully learned it along the way. This is the way to go!
